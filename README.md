# Example Satpy Plugin Package - Composites

This is a toy package to show how to make an independent package that adds
or changes functionality to Satpy. This package specifically adds new
composites, but Satpy also supports adding readers, writers, and enhancements.

See the
[Satpy Plugin Documentation](https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_guide/plugins.html)
for more information.
